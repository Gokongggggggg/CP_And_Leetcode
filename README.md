# 💻 Algorithm Problem Solving & Documentation

Hi there! I'm a Computer Science student from Binus University. In my free time, I enjoy solving algorithmic problems across various platforms.

This repository serves as a personal archive of my solutions for **Competitive Programming** and **LeetCode**.

## ⚡ Current Status: Work in Progress

**Please Note:** This repository is currently undergoing a major restructuring.

* **Migration:** I am in the process of rebuilding and organizing this collection from the ground up.
* **Documentation:** My primary goal is not just to store code, but to document the **thought process, intuition, and approach** for each problem.
* **Completeness:** Many files are currently missing these detailed explanations. **This documentation is still not perfect, and I am actively working on updating them ASAP.**

## 📚 Accessing Detailed Analysis (Notion)

This GitHub repository holds only the final, working code solution.

The **detailed intuition, thought process, complexity analysis (Big O), and step-by-step approach** are centralized in my external Notion workspace.

| **Documentation Hub** | **How to Find the Solution** |
| :--- | :--- |
| ➡️ **[Click Here to View the Notion Database/Wiki]** | Use the Notion search bar and look for the problem name (e.g., "Valid Palindrome" or "Two Sum"). |
